## ‚öôÔ∏è How to use it
You can easily integrate this action to your projects by following the steps below:
1. Copy both files `action.yml` and `notify.js` to your project's `.github/workflows` folder.
2. As it is integrated with the Slack Web-API, you need a SLACK API TOKEN. You can get one by creating a Slack App and installing it to your workspace. You can follow the steps in the [Slack API Documentation](https://api.slack.com/start/quickstart#creating).
3. After getting your Slack API Token, you need to create a Github Secret in your repository. You can do it by going to `Settings > Secrets > New repository secret`. The name of the secret must be `SLACK_API_TOKEN` and the value must be your Slack API Token.
4. After that, you're good to go! Just create a Pull Request and see the magic happening! üéâ

Another good information is that this action is reusable, so after you first instanciate in one of your projects you can call in any other project using the code below in your workflow:
```
Uses:
USER_OR_ORG_NAME/REPO_NAME/.github/workflows/REUSABLE_WORKFLOW_FILE.yml@TAG_OR_BRANCH
```
You can find more information about reusable actions in this [Github Blog post](https://github.blog/2022-02-10-using-reusable-workflows-github-actions/).
